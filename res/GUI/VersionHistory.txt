Version history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed some un-needed meshes from the sample. Minor code cleanups
Added new widget: SimpleBorderButton.
Added new widget: SerpentScaledTopBorder
Added new widget: SerpentScaledBottomBorde
Added new widget: RailedGlyphButton (used only in FrameWindow)

Modified FrameWindow and SerpentPanel: these widgets now contain a subtle highlight of scales.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added new property to the FrameWindow: TitlebarSubPatternTexture, to draw a tiled texture over the titlebar.
(default value: GlossySerpentFHD/SerpentSkinTileDark).
To get the old look and feel of a window, please specify the following property in the layout file:
<Window type="GlossySerpentFHD/FrameWindow" name="yourName" >
  <Property name="TitlebarSubPatternTexture" value="" />

- Added new property to the FrameWindow and SerpentPanel: BackgroundScalesPictureColour, default value: "4714120F"

<Window type="GlossySerpentFHD/FrameWindow" name="yourName" >
  <Property name="BackgroundScalesPictureColour" value="00FFFFFF" />

The highlight is based on a scale armour texture from here: http://opengameart.org/content/commission-medieval


Version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Bumped version information in all XML definition files to 1.0
  - Corrected batches used in set-up of archive file that gets distributed. The previous version (0.9) accidentally had
    files meant for CEGUI 0.7, but was marketed as a CEGUI 0.8 friendly release.

Version 0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Updated skin to CEGUI support 0.8.3
  - CEGUI 0.7.* shall not be officially supported by new releases anymore.
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: Augustin Preda, 2014.01.27. It has been reported and confirmed that the release contained incorrect
    files. Recommended: DO NOT USE. Switch to 1.0 instead. 

Version 0.8.a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Added widgets (provided by Visse):
    - added Menubar widget
    - added PopupMenu widget
    - added MenuItem widget
  - Added FHD versions for Amber and Jade colour variations

Miscellaneous:
  - Integrated fixes reported by Visse

Version 0.8:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed widgets/windows:
  - Radiobutton: removed from looknfeel file. Still present in the scheme file, where it is mapped to a checkbox.

Miscellaneous:
  - Minor improvements to the used sizes and images for combo-boxes.
  - Added FHD (Full HD) variant of the theme, in which all widget pictures have an increased size, to offer higher details on high resolutions. It's typically recommended to use at least 1920x1080 for these. The FHD variant is called "GlossySerpentFHD" and comes with its own data files. Cursors are not yet brought to the FHD size.
  - Removed un-needed code (minor cleanup of used files: imageset and looknfeel)
  - Added intermediate datafiles that can be used with the CEGUI 1.0 specification. In case you were transforming the skin from CEGUI 0.7 to CEGUI 1.0 specs, you can try this to see if it works better. Currently available only for the base skin.
  
Version 0.7:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed widgets/windows:
  - Checkbox32: no longer needed. Simple checkbox can be used instead.
  
Miscellaneous:
  - Added support for custom colouring of items via code. Many images were redone to be gray-scale and have colorized information applied to them via XML. The default theme look might have a somewhat different feel as a result. 
  - Progressbar: added a leading part and one extra layer. The widget should look much nicer now.
  - Button32, Button32_4C, ProgressBar: added extra layers to reduce cut-out of items when resized under the source image size.
  - RadioButton: now using the checkbox widget entirely.
  - FrameWindow: added glyph support.

Version 0.6:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed widgets/windows:
  - SimpleTransparentPanel: redundant due to new property on SimplePanel widget (TransparencyColour)
    - to get the same effect as before, use the property as <Property Name="BackgroundPictureColour" Value="AFFFFFFFF" />

New widgets/windows:
  - Checkbox32: identical to the old Checkbox (the new checkbox underwent minor changes)
  - Checkbox: modified look and feel so that it can be used with smaller sizes. (The imagery is basically the same, but projects like MMiX.Me which use small widgets will look crisper now).
  - SerpentPanel: similar to SimplePanel, but using a different set of pictures, with some snake figures in the corner. Having widgets such as this one was the goal of the skin from the very beginning. :-)
  
Miscellaneous:
  - FrameWindow: decreased minimum relative size from 0.1 to 0.01. The reason behind this is that the frame window (being more of a base widget) is used by many for generic purposes, so 0.1 was too large in some cases.
  - Small changes to the (text) selection brushes. They are "smoother" now.
  - Group Box supports an offset for the caption (property: CaptionOffset; default: 10). Thanks to sabby7890 for the suggestion.  
  - SimplePanel has a transparent middle content by default and a non-transparent border.
    - You can set the background to be non-transparent using the property <Property Name="BackgroundPictureColour" Value="FFFFFFFFF" />
  - Transparency of source pictures removed for SimplePanel, FrameWindow. Now transparency is controlled in the code.
  - Minor changes to the inner shadow of SimplePanel and FrameWindow.
  
Version 0.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
New widgets/windows:
  - ListboxTransparent

Fixes:
  - tooltip border shape corrected

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- progress bar: can now specify the fill colour of the bar.
- added a special version without minimum size option for scrollbar thumbs due to a bug in CEED.
 
Version 0.2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- overall: recolored skin: now has lower contrast in the borders, higher luminosity and a bit more vivid colors in general.

                  Doesn't scale well vertically. Also supports a glyph.
