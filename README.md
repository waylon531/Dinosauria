#Dinosauria 0.1.0 beta

##Introduction
This is a game from the perspective of a dinosaur with the goal of being very realistic (and scientifically accurate). It is currently in a stage where pretty much all hat you can actually do is walk around and look at the graphics. Most of the work so far has been on the graphics, but I plan to implement better gameplay soon.

##Compiling
In the "dinosauira" root direcotry, type:
```
cmake -"Unix Makefiles" #or whatever type of build you want to generate

make -j2
```
Note that if you want documentation to be generated, you must have doxygen installed. In addition, if you want inheritance graphs, you must have graphviz dot installed.
